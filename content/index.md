I'm interested in new technology, currently one 
of the newest and most interesting things out there is serverless 
architecture. I heard about this through my work as a dev ops engineer
and I've created this site as the first step in a personal project to
learn more about these new ideas.

This site is a static website hosted in S3 and generated using markdown
with the help of [phenomic](http://phenomic.io). This means I have no
servers and minimal cost.
