My name is Daniel Williams and this is my website dedicated to my ramblings and personal
projects. I'm interested in trying out new technology and this where I'll record that
process and anything I learn along the way.

I'm currently learning about serverless architecture, I've used some of what I learnt so far
to create this website you see now.

This is a work in progress so feel free to point out any errors or make change suggestions
directly via the [github repository](https://github.com/dannyhw/serverlessblog).

This site is a static website hosted in S3 and generated using markdown
with the help of [phenomic](http://phenomic.io). This means I have no
servers and minimal cost.
